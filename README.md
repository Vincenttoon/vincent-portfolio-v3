## Things Learned

- First Next.js project. Learned fundamentals, structure, functionality and installation of Next.js

- `npm i TypeAnimation` - a lightweight npm package that enables you to add dynamic and animated typing effects to your web projects. It's perfect for creating engaging and interactive user interfaces.

- Further practice creating jsx dynamic NavLinks and more reusable code.

- Familiar, but first use of `@heroicons`

- More practice using `emailjs/brower` (introduction to Resend, but not paying for a domain)

- Tailwind knowledge expanded

- Multiple different css implementations, including transform, translate, gradient, from-include-to

- `npm i framer-motion` - a versatile animation library for React that makes it easy to create fluid and expressive motion in your web applications.

- `npm i react-animated numbers` React component for animating numerical values with smooth transitions. It's perfect for creating dynamic and engaging interfaces with changing numeric content.

- `npm i react-type-animation` React component that brings dynamic and engaging typing animations to your web applications. Easily simulate the appearance of text being typed, creating a lively and interactive user experience.

## Future Improvements
